# SignTrans: Sign Language Translation

Revolutionizing Communication for the Deaf Community with NLP and ISL. Our mission is to harness Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Indian Sign Language (ISL) to empower individuals with hearing disabilities. Join us in breaking communication barriers and enabling fluent expression. Together, let's create a world of inclusive communication.

## Skills

- Django
- Python (Programming Language)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Deployment

The application is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster for scalability and resilience. The project utilizes Docker to containerize the application, allowing easy deployment and management. The system can scale itself based on the workload using Kubernetes' horizontal pod autoscaler. Hosting the application on the Azure cloud provides advantages such as high availability, scalability, and integration with various Azure services.


## How it Works

This project aims to develop a Sign Language Interpreter through Animation, providing a means of communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments. The system utilizes NLP techniques and a translation approach that converts English sentences to Indian Sign Language (ISL) grammar rules in real-time.

The SignTrans application uses natural language processing techniques to preprocess and analyze text. This includes tokenization, which involves breaking down the text into individual words or tokens, and word processing techniques like stemming and lemmatization, which involve reducing words to their base forms. A machine learning model is then used to generate a sequence of sign language gestures that correspond to the input text. The sequence of gestures is then displayed to the user in the form of a video.


## How to Use

To use the SignTrans. You can enter text in the input field and click "Translate" to generate a sign language video.
